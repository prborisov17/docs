# Deleting a {{ dataproc-name }} cluster

You can delete a cluster along with all the data stored in it. Note that data backups are not created automatically: if you want to save data for cluster recovery or future use, you can do that, for example, using [{{ objstorage-full-name }}]({{ link-cloud-services }}/storage).

To delete a {{ dataproc-name }} cluster, the user must be assigned the `editor` and `dataproc.agent` roles. For more information, see the [role description](../security/index.md#roles-list).

## Before deleting a cluster {#before-you-delete}

[Disable deletion protection](./cluster-update.md) for the cluster if it is enabled.
