# {{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster backups in {{ objstorage-name }}

Data in [{{ managed-k8s-name }} clusters](../../managed-kubernetes/concepts/index.md#kubernetes-cluster) is securely stored and replicated within the {{ yandex-cloud }} infrastructure. However, you can back up data from [{{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster node groups](../../managed-kubernetes/concepts/index.md#node-group) at any time and store them in [{{ objstorage-full-name }}](../../storage/) or other types of storage.

You can create backups of {{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster node group data using the [Velero](https://velero.io/) tool. It supports working with {{ yandex-cloud }} [disks](../../compute/concepts/disk.md) using the {{ k8s }} CSI driver and helps create [snapshots of disks](../../compute/concepts/snapshot.md) and [volumes](../../managed-kubernetes/concepts/volume.md).

When working with Velero that is installed manually, you can use [nfs](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#nfs), [emptyDir](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#emptydir), [local](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/volumes/#local), or any other type of volumes without built-in support for snapshots. To use such a volume type, install Velero with the [restic plugin](https://velero.io/docs/v1.8/restic/). Velero installed from [{{ marketplace-name }}](/marketplace/products/yc/velero-yc-csi) does not include the restic plugin.

In this article, you will learn how to create a backup of a {{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster node group using Velero, save it in {{ objstorage-name }}, and restore it in a node group in a different cluster:
1. [Create a backup of your {{ managed-k8s-name }} node group](#backup).
1. [Recover a node group of another {{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster from a backup](#restore).

If you no longer need the resources you created, [delete them](#clear-out).

## Getting started {#before-you-begin}

### Prepare the infrastructure {#deploy-infrastructure}

{% list tabs %}

- Manually

   1. [Create two {{ managed-k8s-name }} clusters](../../managed-kubernetes/operations/kubernetes-cluster/kubernetes-cluster-create.md).

      One {{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster will be used for creating a node group backup and the other one for restoring data from the backup.

      If you intend to use your clusters within the {{ yandex-cloud }} network, there is no need to allocate them a public IP address. To allow connections from outside the network, assign a public IP to the clusters.

   1. [Create a node group](../../managed-kubernetes/operations/node-group/node-group-create.md) in each cluster and allocate a public IP address to each group.
   1. [Create a bucket in {{ objstorage-name }}](../../storage/operations/buckets/create.md).
   1. [Create a service account](../../iam/operations/sa/create.md) with the `compute.admin` [role](../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md) for the [folder](../../resource-manager/concepts/resources-hierarchy.md#folder) to work with Velero.
   1. Grant the [service account](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md) **READ and WRITE** permissions to a [bucket](../../storage/concepts/bucket.md) in {{ objstorage-name }}. To do this, [configure the bucket ACL](../../storage/operations/buckets/edit-acl.md).
   1. [Create a static access key](../../iam/operations/sa/create-access-key.md) for the service account and save its ID and value. You will not be able to get the key value again.

- Using {{ TF }}

   1. {% include [terraform-install-without-setting](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/install-without-setting.md) %}
   1. {% include [terraform-authentication](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/authentication.md) %}
   1. {% include [terraform-setting](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/setting.md) %}
   1. {% include [terraform-configure-provider](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/configure-provider.md) %}

   1. Download the [velero-backup.tf](https://github.com/yandex-cloud/examples/tree/master/tutorials/terraform/managed-kubernetes/velero-backup.tf) configuration file to the same working directory.

      This file describes:
      * [Network](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#network).
      * [Subnet](../../vpc/concepts/network.md#subnet).
      * [Security groups](../../vpc/concepts/security-groups.md) and rules required for running {{ managed-k8s-name }} clusters:
         * Rules for service traffic.
         * Rule for connecting to services from the internet.
      * Two {{ managed-k8s-name }} clusters and their node groups.
      * [Service account](../../iam/concepts/users/service-accounts.md) required to use the {{ managed-k8s-name }} clusters and node groups.
      * Service account with the `compute.admin` [role](../../iam/concepts/access-control/roles.md) to work with Velero.
      * Static access key for the service account used to work with Velero.
      * [Bucket](../../storage/concepts/bucket.md) in {{ objstorage-name }}.
   1. In `velero-backup.tf`, specify:
      * `folder_id`: [ID of the folder](../../resource-manager/operations/folder/get-id.md) to create resources in.
      * `k8s_version`: [{{ k8s }} version](../../managed-kubernetes/concepts/release-channels-and-updates.md) 1.22 or higher.
      * `zone_a_v4_cidr_blocks`: CIDR of the subnet hosting the {{ managed-k8s-name }} clusters.
      * `sa_name_k8s`: Name of the {{ managed-k8s-name }} clusters' service account.
      * `sa_name_velero`: Name of the service account to work with Velero.
      * `storage_sa_id`: ID of the service account with the `storage.admin` role. It will be used to create a bucket in {{ objstorage-name }} with `READ and WRITE` permissions in the [ACL](../../storage/concepts/acl.md) for the `sa_name_velero` service account.
      * `bucket_name`: {{ objstorage-name }} bucket name.
   1. Run the `terraform init` command in the directory with the configuration file. This command initializes the provider specified in the configuration files and enables you to use the provider resources and data sources.
   1. Make sure the {{ TF }} configuration files are correct using this command:

      ```bash
      terraform validate
      ```

      If there are any errors in the configuration files, {{ TF }} will point them out.
   1. Create the required infrastructure:

      {% include [terraform-apply](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/apply.md) %}

      {% include [explore-resources](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/explore-resources.md) %}

   1. Get and save the ID and value of the static access key for the service account used to work with Velero.
      * Key ID:

         ```bash
         terraform output -raw access_key
         ```

      * Key value:

         ```bash
         terraform output -raw secret_key
         ```

{% endlist %}

### Configure additional settings {#additional-settings}

1. Select a [Velero client](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero/releases) for your platform based on the [compatibility table](https://github.com/vmware-tanzu/velero#velero-compatibility-matrix).
1. Download the Velero client, extract the contents of the archive, and install it. For more information about installation, see the [Velero documentation](https://velero.io/docs/main/basic-install/#install-the-cli).
1. Make sure the Velero client has been installed. To do this, run the following command:

   ```bash
   velero version
   ```

   Result:

   ```text
   Client:
           Version: v1.10.3
           Git commit: 18ee078dffd9345df610e0ca9f61b31124e93f50
   ```

## Backups {#backup}

To back up the {{ managed-k8s-name }} node group data:
1. [Install kubectl]({{ k8s-docs }}/tasks/tools/install-kubectl) and [configure it to work with the first {{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster](../../managed-kubernetes/operations/connect/index.md#kubectl-connect).

   {% include [kubectl info](../../_includes/managed-kubernetes/kubectl-info.md) %}

1. {% include [install-velero](../../_includes/managed-kubernetes/install-velero.md) %}
1. Back up data from the {{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster node group:

   ```bash
   velero backup create my-backup
   ```

   Result:

   ```text
   Backup request "my-backup" submitted successfully.
   Run `velero backup describe my-backup` or `velero backup logs my-backup` for more details.
   ```

1. Wait for the backup to complete. The value displayed in the `STATUS` field will be `Completed`.

   ```bash
   velero backup get
   ```

   Result:

   ```text
   NAME       STATUS     ERRORS  WARNINGS  CREATED                        EXPIRES  STORAGE LOCATION  SELECTOR
   my-backup  Completed  0       0         2020-10-19 17:13:25 +0300 MSK  29d      default           <none>
   ```

## Restoring data from backups {#restore}

To restore data from the {{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster node group:
1. [Configure kubectl](../../managed-kubernetes/operations/connect/index.md#kubectl-connect) to work with the second {{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster.

   {% include [kubectl info](../../_includes/managed-kubernetes/kubectl-info.md) %}

1. {% include [install-velero](../../_includes/managed-kubernetes/install-velero.md) %}
1. Make sure the data backup is displayed in the new {{ managed-k8s-name }} cluster:

   ```bash
   velero backup get
   ```

   Result:

   ```text
   NAME       STATUS     ERRORS  WARNINGS  CREATED                        EXPIRES  STORAGE LOCATION  SELECTOR
   my-backup  Completed  0       0         2020-10-19 17:13:25 +0300 MSK  29d      default           <none>
   ```

1. Restore data from the backup:

   ```bash
   velero restore create my-restore \
     --exclude-namespaces velero \
     --from-backup my-backup
   ```

   Where:

   * `--exclude-namespaces`: List of namespaces to exclude from the recovery process.
   * `--from-backup`: Name of the backup for recovery.

   Result:

   ```text
   Restore request "my-restore" submitted successfully.
   Run `velero restore describe my-restore` or `velero restore logs my-restore` for more details.
   ```

1. Wait for the backup restoration to complete. The value displayed in the `STATUS` field will be `Completed`.

   ```bash
   velero get restore
   ```

   Result:

   ```text
   NAME        BACKUP     STATUS     STARTED                        COMPLETED                      ERRORS  WARNINGS  CREATED                        SELECTOR
   my-restore  my-backup  Completed  2020-10-20 14:04:55 +0300 MSK  2020-10-20 14:05:22 +0300 MSK  0       23        2020-10-20 14:04:55 +0300 MSK  <none>
   ```

## Delete the resources you created {#clear-out}

If you no longer need the resources you created, delete them:

{% list tabs %}

- Manually

   * [Delete the clusters {{ managed-k8s-name }}](../../managed-kubernetes/operations/kubernetes-cluster/kubernetes-cluster-delete.md).
   * If you reserved [public static IP addresses](../../vpc/concepts/address.md#public-addresses) for the {{ managed-k8s-name }} clusters, [delete them](../../vpc/operations/address-delete.md).
   * [Delete the {{ objstorage-name }} bucket](../../storage/operations/buckets/delete.md).
   * [Delete the service account](../../iam/operations/sa/delete.md) used to work with Velero.

- Using {{ TF }}

   1. In the terminal window, switch to the directory containing the infrastructure plan.
   1. Delete the `velero-backup.tf` configuration file.
   1. Make sure the {{ TF }} configuration files are correct using this command:

      ```bash
      terraform validate
      ```

      If there are any errors in the configuration files, {{ TF }} will point them out.
   1. Confirm updating the resources.

      {% include [terraform-apply](../../_includes/mdb/terraform/apply.md) %}

      This will delete all the resources described in the `velero-backup.tf` configuration file.

{% endlist %}
